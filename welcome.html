            <h2>Greetings from Datuk Dr. Anis Yusal Yusoff</h2>
            <p>Choosing a field of study at the postgraduate level is not a simple decision. Prospective students,
                parents,
                and even employers must carefully consider many factors before making a choice. A common concern for
                students and parents is whether a master's degree will lead to a job with a good salary. Some prioritise
                a
                degree that ensures employability, allowing graduates to secure work soon after completing their
                studies.
                <br><br>
                There are many reasons why Master of Public Policy at The International Institute of Public Policy and
                Management (INPUMA) of Universiti Malaya (UM) should be your choice for your postgraduate studies.
                <br><br>
                First, UM is the only public university in Malaysia that offers a Master's degree in Public Policy
                (MPP).
                Universiti Malaya is also the top university in the country and ranks 60th globally. While we understand
                the
                importance of finding a job and earning a good income after graduation, our focus is on cultivating
                future
                policy formulators with integrity and a sense of responsibility. We aim to nurture graduates with strong
                moral values who are dedicated to solving societal issues. We seek to develop public policy scholars who
                place the nation's and society's welfare above personal interests.
                <br><br>
                Second, our faculty comprises leading academics who possess in-depth knowledge of both theory and
                methodology of public policy, as well as experienced professionals who have spent decades directly
                involved
                in policy-making within various government sectors. This blend of expertise ensures that your learning
                experience at INPUMA will be truly unique.
                <br><br>
                In addition to classroom learning and hands-on experience, you will also benefit from participation in
                various other initiatives offered by INPUMA. Third, INPUMA is a partner to the Ministry of Foreign
                Affairs,
                Malaysia in running the Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme (MTCP), which provides training to
                senior
                officials from developing countries as part of Malaysia's capacity-building efforts. Additionally,
                INPUMA
                organises various trainings and masterclasses for international participants on public policy.
                <br><br>
                Fourth, our activities beyond a regular classroom teaching will provide our students with valuable
                opportunities to gain experience and build international networks. For instance, recently, we trained 20
                senior government officials from the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia and Timor Leste. Beyond our academic
                focus, INPUMA is also deeply engaged with the local community. We regularly hold roundtable discussions
                to
                gather public opinions on public interest issues, while our experts analyse these issues and prepare
                policy
                briefs. Another significant initiative under INPUMA is the Center for Leadership and Professional
                Development (UM LEAD), which provides training for senior executives through its signature "Purposeful
                and
                Principled Leadership" programme. Recently, UM LEAD conducted courses for senior officials from Moscow,
                Russia, and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) of the Philippines.
                We are keenly aware of the rapid technological advancements shaping today's world. In this digital
                information age, technology drives our economy, politics, and education. The future belongs to those who
                understand this environment, innovate within it, and advocate for the underserved. These future leaders
                will
                be diverse, imaginative, and driven by a desire to create meaningful change. This is the kind of leaders
                we
                at INPUMA would like to produce. At INPUMA, the Master of Public Policy (MPP) programme equips you with
                a
                strong foundation in the social sciences, combined with practical applications.
                <br><br>
                One of the defining features of the MPP programme is its focus on real-world practice. You will apply
                what
                you learn immediately through capstone projects, case studies, hands-on learning experiences, and
                optional
                internships, delivering lasting results. The core curriculum is interdisciplinary, exposing you to
                analytical methods, conceptual frameworks, and ways of thinking that empower you to develop solutions to
                public problems with values of integrity. We want to support you in surpassing your academic goals while
                also enjoying the vibrant social life at Universiti Malaya. Please take full advantage of what INPUMA
                has to
                offer, and build the knowledge you need for a successful future. All the best!
